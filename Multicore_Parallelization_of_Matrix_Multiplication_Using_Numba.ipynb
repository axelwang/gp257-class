    "## Multicore Parallelization of Matrix Multiplication Using Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will be using Numba to accelerate matrix-matrix multiplications by exploiting parallelism. Even most laptops today have Multicore CPUs, where a *core* is a microprocessor, and each core is usually a copy of the each other core. Accelerating the marrix-matrix multiplication operation is a good analog to accelerating other types of operators and computationally intense kernels, codes, and algorithms. Furthermore, the structure of matricies makes matrix-matrix multiplication a good place start learning how to parallelize code.\n",

    "### Exercise 2: Using Numba to speed up matrix multiplication: \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, numba to speedup our matrx-matrix multiplication function below. However, there is an interesting twist to this exercise. We will write six versions of the naive function you wrote above. One function for each of the six possible permutations of three loops used to calculate the multplication (i.e. ijk, ikj, jik, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The tasks for this exercise:\n",
    "1. Make six copies your code for the my_naive_matmul(), one copy for each of the possible permutations and define them in the cell bellow:\n",
    "    - One of these function will have the same loop order as the my_naive_matmul() function. \n",
    "    - However name these functions: numba_mul_\\<perm\\>(), where \\<perm\\> should be replaced by the specific loop order of the function.\n",
    "2. In the cell that follows your function definitions, test and compare the accuracy and runtime of your functions against the numpy.dot() function.\n",
    "    - Test with a square Matrices: $A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$. For the cases when $N = 128, 256,$ and $512$.\n",
    "    - For each matrix set their dtype as: dtype=np.float64\n",
    "    - Calculate and show the error between your functions and the numpy.dot() function. (Same as in Exercise 1.)\n",
    "    - Calculate and show the *speedup* that the fastest function has versus the all the other functions.\n",
    "    - You should notice that one of your permutation functions is faster than the others. For this case show the following:\n",
    "        - Calculate and show the *speedup* that the fastest permutation function has versus the my_naive_matmul().\n",
    "        - Calculate and show the *speedup* that the fastest permutation function has when $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all of dtype=np.float64 vs all are of dtype=np.float32.\n",
    "3. Create your matrices using random numbers. (Same as in Exercise 1.) \n",
    "4. For each function, you need to add a function decorator for numba. Numba will *JIT* the function (**J**ust **I**n **T**ime compilation). \n",
    "    - Use the flag to keep a \"cache\" of the compiled code (not to be confused with CPU cache). **Note**: to get accurate timings, you will need to run your tests **twice**, because during the first run, the code is compiled and this compile time will be included in your runtime. After the first run, the compiled binary will be stored, so consecutive runs will be faster.\n",
    "    - Use the flag to use *fast math*\n",
    "    - Use the flag to disable the Python Global Interpretor Lock (GIL).\n",

    "My answers:\n",
    "1. This has to do with cache hits or miss. Numpy defaults to row-major, which means when a value is read in from memory, its neighbouring values from the same row are also being moved to the cache. Here, we have three matrices, A, B and C to access. The permutation that has the access pattern with the smallest rate of cahce miss will generally be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. np.dot() is always much faster, even though I have made sure to run the JIT compiled functions twice or more. I think the reason here is that Numba only provides significant performance gains as compared to native Python code, as it does here, but when compared with the highly-optimized Numpy code (and this optimization can really come from several aspects, e.g. Numpy achieves better vectorization and/or somehow minimizes cache misses etc.) it often falls behind. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. float32 is slightly faster. Roughly, it is about 1-5 % faster, although there is a variation from run to run and case to case. \n",
    "4. Yes. The serial part of matrix-matrix multiplication should be computing each individual element, $C_{ij}$, of the resulting matrix, which is done by performing dot-product of each row of the first matrix and each column of the second matrix. Because all of the individual multiplications in the dot product have to be performed *before* the sum is performed to get $C_{ij}$, this is the part that is limiting performance according to Amdahl's Law. This whole process though, can be parallelized and being done by different threads/core. As a result, as the matrix size increases, the portion of the serial tasks increases, leading to smaller performance gains for the 'numba_kij' as compared with 'my_naive_matmul'. Using the data type of 'float32' decreases the complexity for the serial part, hence making the performance better. I don't think this part can be parallelized in general, unless one uses some special techniques such as to reduce the matrix size to reduce the serial portion. But then at the end the individual blocks still have to be recombined, and one needs to carefully think about whether there are any gains for utilizing such special tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Due to the nature of the tasks, certain codes are inherently not parallelizeable, so of course not all codes should be parallelized. As for the specific case of matrix-matrix multiplication, I think this is an area of active research and people are constantly trying to come up with novel techniques (the latest one I heard I think was last year, with an AI based method). While these new techniques often bring performance increase, I think they also tend to become less and less general, i.e. you need specific kinds of matrices or hardware to achieve that performance gain.
